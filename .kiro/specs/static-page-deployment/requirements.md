# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a static page deployment system using Vite as the build tool, with the capability to host the built application on repurposed.ch. The system should provide an automated build and deployment pipeline that transforms the current WebGL shader playground into a production-ready static website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build my WebGL shader application as a static site using Vite, so that I can deploy it to any static hosting service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL generate optimized static assets in a dist directory
2. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL bundle all TypeScript, React, and GLSL shader files into optimized JavaScript and CSS
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL handle GLSL file imports with proper text loading
4. IF the build process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the static build to repurposed.ch, so that the WebGL shader playground is accessible via a public URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL upload the built static assets to repurposed.ch
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL configure proper MIME types for all asset files including GLSL shaders
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide the public URL where the site is accessible
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and rollback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated deployment pipeline, so that I can deploy updates with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the build and deployment process
2. WHEN the automated pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute build, test, and deployment steps in sequence
3. IF any pipeline step fails THEN the system SHALL halt execution and notify of the failure
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the live site with the new version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user visiting the deployed site, I want the WebGL shader playground to work correctly, so that I can interact with all the shader effects and preprocessors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads THEN the system SHALL render the WebGL background with default shaders
2. WHEN users interact with shader controls THEN the system SHALL update the visual effects in real-time
3. WHEN switching between different preprocessors THEN the system SHALL apply the correct shader transformations
4. IF WebGL is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate fallback message
